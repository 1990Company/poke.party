# The necessary secrets are:
# - APP_URL - for preventing CORS errors
# - JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY - for Supabase @link https://supabase.com
#
# For local development, you can create a file called .dev.vars and use dotenv syntax.
#
# For deployed environments, you can use wrangler secrets to set these values.
# For example:
# Run `echo <VALUE> | wrangler secret put <NAME>` for each of these
# Or use the Cloudflare web interface.
